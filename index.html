          A Low-Cost Carrier (LCC), commonly known as a budget airline, focuses on minimizing operating costs as opposed to a Full-Service Carrier (FSC). Minimizing operational costs can be done by having single aircraft fleets, single cabin configurations, choosing secondary airports, as well as offering only the minimum amenities needed for transporting a person from point A to point B as a part of the ticket price while imposing additional charges for incentives such as in-flight meals and check-in baggage. With lower operating costs, cost savings can be passed on to the traveller, encouraging more passengers to travel. [1] LCCs compete with each other by offering lower ticket prices than their competitors. With seating configuration limits, budget airlines have reached a point where ticket prices can no longer be driven any lower. This creates a desire for a different competitive factor, onboard comfort. This factor is dependent on many factors like service, interior, refreshments, etc, but while there are many factors of an onboard experience that contribute to comfort, only aspects of the aircraft seat affect discomfort. Factors contributing to discomfort must be eliminated for comfort to be experienced. This project aims to redesign LCC aircraft seats to eliminate discomfort in passengers' experience, particularly during long-haul flights. This report will discuss the problem clarification that led to this project, detail the ideation process of the proposed solution, outline the testing strategy, and present the proposed prototyping plan for the selected solution.
